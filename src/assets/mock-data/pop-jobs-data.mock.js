We're a leading global learning company and one of the world's largest education platforms, with more than 67 million learners. Our goal is to provide flexible, effective skill development to empower organizations and individuals.\n\nTalented people are everywhere, and the right opportunity can be hard to come by. That's why we're focused on revolutionizing learning, using our skills and expertise to help others develop theirs and reach their full potential. Individually, we bring our unique perspective to reimagine the way we share knowledge. Together, we can improve lives by making learning more accessible for our learners, our instructors, and businesses around the world.\n\nThis hybrid position requires two days per week at the Austin office.\n\nAbout you\n\nYou're an analytical problem-solver ready to put your skills toward purposeful work that has a global impact. You want to lead the way in innovation, exploring the latest technologies and finding new solutions. You thrive in a collaborative environment and are eager to work with and learn alongside the best in Product, Design, and Engineering.\n\nAbout this role\n\nUdemy is searching for a Software Engineer II who embodies our values of authenticity, continuous learning, leans into experimentation, being results-oriented, and being individually humble, yet collectively proud. We expect you to be proficient React, Typescript with a working knowledge of Graph\n\nQL and monitoring and observability. Our ideal candidate will be comfortable addressing moderately complex problems, including navigating projects with ambiguous parameters.\n\nAs an organization, 'we are always learning'. This manifests in our habitual learning approach, constructive debates and plugging into our platforms for organizational learning. Your dedication to continual growth, openness to robust discussions and leveraging our solutions for learning will be pivotal.\n\nWhat you'll be doing:\n• Implement product features using your foundational knowledge in React, Typescript and to expertly apply this knowledge to meet our team's objectives.\n• Apply Graph\n\nQL and monitoring and observability to ensure smooth execution of product features.\n• Generate value across various teams and apply basic concepts and procedures under guidance.\n• Follow general instructions on routine work from your manager, and be able to comprehend detailed instructions on new assignments or projects.\n• Optimizing code and processes to help your team achieve their goals.\nWhat you'll have:\n• Demonstrated abilities in React, Typescript or some front-end framework.\n• Graph\n\nQL and monitoring and observability.\nWe understand that not everyone will match each of the above qualifications. However, we also realize that everyone has unique experiences that can add value to our company. Even if you think your background might not perfectly align, we'd love to hear from you!\n\nLife at Udemy\n\nWe aspire to be as vibrant and dynamic as the communities we serve, as inquisitive as those who use our platform, and as revolutionary as the future we strive to open for everyone. Here are some of the things we love about life at Udemy:\n• We're invested in creating an inclusive environment that welcomes a diverse range of backgrounds and experiences. From creating employee resource groups, ensuring we're a Fair Pay Workplace, and building a flexible work culture, our belonging, equity, diversity, and inclusion (BEDI) initiatives always put our people first. We want you to be able to bring your authentic self to work because when we all do, we're better for it.\n• Learning is what we do - inside and out. Our Learning & Development team is second to none, helping ensure your journey is one of continuous progression. You'll also have unlimited access to Udemy courses, monthly UDays (meeting-free professional development days), and a generous annual professional development stipend.\n• Our reason to exist is to revolutionize learning - that calls for taking risks and learning from failures. Whether it's our hackathons (a company-wide effort to envision new possibilities for our product) or sharing our prototypes, we see experimentation as a crucial step on the path to success.\n• We're committed to creating world-class employee experiences and are proud of the recognition of this by Great Place to Work and Built In Best Places to Work.\nOf course, the best thing about being part of Udemy is knowing your work makes a difference for people and organizations around the world. You've got the skills; why not use them to help others develop theirs?\n\nAt Udemy, we value diversity and inclusion and consider qualified applicants without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, age, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital or family status, veteran status, medical condition, or disability. We will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.\n\nOur Benefits Start With U\n\nOu…",
